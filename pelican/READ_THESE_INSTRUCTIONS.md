The subway map materials are not on the `pelican` branch,
so you cannot make the `pelican` site without an extra step.

You will need to clone the `subway` branch to the `subway` 
folder by executing the following command in the current 
directory:

```
git clone -b subway https://git.charlesreid1.com/charlesreid1/git-subway-maps.git subway
```

Now the subway branch is located in the `subway/` folder,
and running `pelican content` will now generate the content.
